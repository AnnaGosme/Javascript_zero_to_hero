//Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. Each of them asked 5 dog owners aabout theur dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and is a puppy if it is less than 3 years old.
// Create a function 'checkDogs' which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate') and does the following:
//1. Julia found that the owners of the first and last two dogs actually have cats not dogs => create a shallow copy of Julia's array and remove the cats from that copied array (it's bad practice to mutate function parameters)
//2. Create an array with both Julia's corrected array and Kate's data.
//3. For each remaining dog console.log whether it is an adult ('Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old') or a puppy ('Dog number 2 is still a puppy').
//4. Run the function for both test datasets:

// Test Data 1:
const julia = [3, 5, 2, 12, 71];
const kate = [4, 1, 15, 8, 3];

// Test Data 2:
//Julia: [9, 16, 6, 8, 3]
//Kate:  [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

const checkDogs = function (dogsJulia, dogsKate) {
  //   const newDogsJulia = dogsJulia.slice(1, -1);
  const newDogsJulia = dogsJulia.slice();
  newDogsJulia.splice(0, 1);
  newDogsJulia.splice(-2);

  //   const allDogs = [...newDogsJulia, ...dogsKate];
  const allDogs = newDogsJulia.concat(dogsKate);
  console.log(allDogs);

  allDogs.forEach(function (dog, index) {
    dog >= 3
      ? console.log(
          `Dog number ${index + 1} is an adult, and is ${dog} years old`
        )
      : console.log(`Dog number ${index + 1} is still a puppy`);
  });
};

// Challenge 2

// Julia and Kate want to convert dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.

// Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge' which accepts an array of dog's ages ('ages') and does the following things in order:

// 1. Calculate the dogs' ages in human years using the following formula :
//if the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge
//if the dog is > 2 years old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4

//2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old).

//3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs.

//4. Run the function for both test datasets

//        return average
//     }, 0);
