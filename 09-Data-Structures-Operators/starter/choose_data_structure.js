// SOURCES OF DATA
//1- From the program => written directly in the source code
//2- From the UI => input from the user of written in the DOM
//3- From external sources => data fetched from web API (application programming interface)

// collection of data => data structure : 
//if Simple List => arrays or sets
//if key/value pairs => objects or maps (keys allow us to describe values)

//ARRAYS VS SETS => simple lists of values that do not need to be described

//ARRAYS use when =>
// ordered list of values (might contain duplicates)
// manipulate data

//SETS use when =>
// working with unique values
// high-performance is important
// remove duplicates from arrays

//OBJECTS =>
// most traditional key/value storage solution
// easier to write and access with . and []
//functions as values because gives access to this keyword
//when working with json data

//MAPS 
// better performance
// keys can be of any data type
// easy to iterate
// easy to compute size
